# Thesis - Counting subgraphs

This is the repository used for the thesis of Christian Janos Lebeda and Jonas Mortensen under the supervision of Radu-Cristian Curticapean and Holger Dell.

The repository contains two projects.

The first will include an implementation of the algorithm for counting subgraphs described in the research paper [Homomorphisms Are a Good Basis for Counting Small Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01595).

The second project will be used for conducting performance experiments of said implementation.
